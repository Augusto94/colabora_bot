## Installing the bot

### Settings file
- Create a file in the root of the project called `.env`, it will be used to save the bot configuration variables.
- Copy the contents of the `.end.example` file to the newly created `.env` file.
> Note that this sample file contains the `DEBUG=True` variable, this will disable the bot external dependencies to run smoothly locally.

### Configuring external dependencies

### Collaborating with the bot (and being a very nice person)

**Colaboradados** is a nonprofit initiative made by the community with its own help. To help with our database you can resolve our issues or directly editing our csv file.

Please be aware that our program was created with the Brazilian national scope in mind, so your is - should be - always in Portuguese, where possible. Avoid foreignness and collaborate so that our code is studied by all those interested in transparency.

Our project is a gateway for people from various fields to be interested in the participatory techno-civic process, so we believe that the bot should be easy to understand for those who are not familiar with more advanced programming techniques.
